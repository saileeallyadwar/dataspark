# Data Analytics and Visualization Project

## Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive data analysis pipeline using SQL, Python (via Jupyter Notebooks), and Power BI. It includes:

- **Data Extraction & Cleaning** using SQL queries and Python.
- **Data Merging and Transformation** with `merged_data.csv`.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** in Jupyter Notebook (`Final.ipynb`).
- **Power BI Dashboard** for interactive visualizations (`dashboard.pbix`).
- **Command Reference** for SQL and Python (`Commands.ipynb`).

## Files Description

| File Name          | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `Final.ipynb`      | Main notebook containing the complete data analysis, visualizations, and insights. |
| `Commands.ipynb`   | Jupyter Notebook with frequently used SQL and Python commands for quick reference. |
| `merged_data.csv`  | Final merged dataset used for analysis and visualization. |
| `dashboard.pbix`   | Power BI report for visualizing key metrics and trends. |
| `sql.sql`          | SQL script used for querying and preparing data before analysis. |

## How to Use

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Run the SQL queries in `sql.sql` on your database to extract and preprocess the raw data.

2. **Data Analysis**
   - Open `Final.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Ensure required libraries are installed (e.g., `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
   - Execute all cells to view data insights and visualizations.

3. **Dashboard Visualization**
   - Open `dashboard.pbix` in Microsoft Power BI.
   - If prompted, update the data source to point to `merged_data.csv`.
   - Interact with the dashboard to explore key metrics and visual stories.

4. **Command Reference**
   - Refer to `Commands.ipynb` for quick access to useful SQL and Python commands.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn (install via `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn`)
- Microsoft Power BI Desktop
- A relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for running SQL queries
